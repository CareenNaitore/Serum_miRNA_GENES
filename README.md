# Readme
This directory contains the code used for the bioinformatics analysis applied to obtain the results for the manuscript:
"Differential expression of serum microRNAs implies altered CD4+ T cell development in severe equine asthma"
There are three main scripts:
1. File "code_mirdeep.txt" contains the code for the mirna expression profiling and novel miRNA identification using miRDeep2
2. File "differential_expression_code.txt" contains the R code for the differential expression analysis using DESeq2 and edgeR
3. File "KStest_code.txt" contains the python code that was used for running the iterative KS-test appraoch and based on an approach published recently by Farrell and Shaughnessy et al. (2015) in PLOS one
